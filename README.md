# guthub-test

#
#	this is the first update to the readme file
# 	it appears to be impossible to use notepad and get rid of the "no newline at end of file" error
#	github doesnt help much with the solution either
#	i think a proper code editor is required maybe?
#	fuckin geeks just do not know how to help people properly.
#	pressing 'enter' in notepad does not get create a newline as it should, or maybe github desktop talks shit?
# new save using visual studio code
